        Alongside my technical interests, I also enjoy expressing myself creatively. I have dabbled in HTML, CSS, and Adobe Illustrator. The result of such ventures is the website you are looking at right now.

        I love flying and the sense of exploration that comes with it. I have been flying planes in a simulator since high school, and I am now working towards getting a real-life Private Pilot License.

        Exploring my local city and all of its simple beauty helps me balance out the stress of my highly technical side. My favorite destinations include rivers, lakes, parks, gardens and all thing nature.
